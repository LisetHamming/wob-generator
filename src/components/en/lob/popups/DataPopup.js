		p:
			"You don't need to explain the importance of your request, and the government agency may not even ask. However, specifying the purpose of your request can help government agencies better understand the documents you are seeking. Sometimes, it may be wise not to disclose the news you are investigating. Consider what is prudent."

		p:
			"You can submit your Woo request on behalf of an (media) organization. In that case, ensure that you are authorized and include the authorization with your request. The request may be rejected if you lack the proper authorization. Organizations appealing to the administrative court also face higher fees than individuals, which can quickly differ by around one hundred and fifty euros. On the other hand, working for a well-known (media) organization can carry weight in the processing of your request. A compromise is to mention the (media) organization you work for but not officially submit the request on behalf of the organization. Check the option below in that case."

		p:
			"There are numerous government agencies, also called 'administrative bodies,' in the Netherlands: municipalities, provinces, ministries, water boards, the police, and inspection services. There are also so-called 'independent administrative bodies' such as the Social Insurance Bank (SVB) and the Central Bureau of Driving Certificates (CBR). As of May 1, 2022, several agencies, including the First and Second Chamber, the Court of Audit, and the National Ombudsman, have been added under the Woo. All these agencies fall under the Woo and can be found using the Woo generator.",
		p2:
			"The database of government agencies falling under the Woo has been compiled by the members of the VVOJ's Woo working group. To our knowledge, this is the first such database in the Netherlands. All the mentioned agencies are included, but it doesn't mean the database is exhaustive. It's possible that we've overlooked some agencies, and government agencies may be abolished or change names. The database remains in constant development. Suggestions and updates are welcome: info@woo-generator.nl",

		h1: "Correct government agency?",
		p:
			"First, consider which government agency holds the documents on your subject. If you're unsure, search online for your subject and see which government agencies appear. You can also submit the same request to different agencies. Sometimes, one government agency falls under the responsibility of another. For example, if you're unsure whether the documents are with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (IND) or the Ministry of Justice and Security, choose the 'highest' authority, in this case, the ministry. Keep in mind that agencies under less scrutiny might release documents more easily. So, think about where you have the best chance!",
		p2:
			"And rest assured: the agency where you submit your Woo request is obliged to forward your request to the correct agency. For added security, the generator reminds the government agency of this obligation in the 'forwarding' paragraph."

		p:
			"If you know the name of the highest-ranking official of the agency, such as the minister, the state secretary, the commissioner of the king, etc., you can add it yourself after downloading your Wob request draft. But it's not obligatory. Simply use 'Dear Sir/Madam' if you prefer."
	},
	8: {
		id: "8",
		h1: "Why precision matters",
		p:
			"A too broad or unclear formulation of your subject can lead the government to request clarification. Under the Woo, the government agency must inform you of this within two weeks of receiving your request. Only after you have clarified your request does the decision period begin. Unnecessary weeks may pass before the government starts processing your request."
	},

		id: "9",
		h1: "Environment",
		p:
			"If your Woo request pertains to environmental information, some special rules apply. Based on the Aarhus Convention, certain reasons for refusing environmental information are not or are less applicable. If you're unsure if your request concerns environmental information, check Article 19.1a of the Environmental Management Act."

On the next page, you can describe these documents and have the opportunity to request the disclosure of underlying documents related to a specific document. This provides insight into the creation of the document/documents, the individuals or organizations involved, changes in direction, etc.",
		p2:
			"To limit the complexity of the Woo generator, it's not possible to tick both options simultaneously. If you want all documents on this subject, in addition to these specific documents, you'll need to generate and send two separate letters. The government agency may still consider both letters as one request. Keep in mind that the more documents you request, the longer it may take to receive them. Make sure to send both letters on the same day if you want the deadlines to align."

			"Sometimes, you know that a particular government agency has dealt with a subject, but you don't know which documents they have. In that case, you can request all documents about the subject. This is also called a 'dragnet request.'",
		p2:
			"It's usually wise to limit such a request in time and exclude certain types of documents. After all, you don't want to be overwhelmed with irrelevant documents or unnecessarily burden government officials, causing delays in receiving the documents. You can indicate this on the next page."

Of course, you can also ask the government for information that is not already on a data carrier, such as what the municipality thinks about a particular development or what the municipality plans to do about it. This is not a Woo request but a regular information request. The Woo generator is not intended for this purpose.'

		p:
			"It's usually wise to limit such a request in time and exclude certain types of documents. After all, you don't want to be overwhelmed with irrelevant documents or unnecessarily burden government officials, causing delays in receiving the documents. Emails, for example, can provide insight into the decision-making process, the tone of communication between certain individuals, and the frequency of contact. Still, emails can also be about entirely irrelevant matters, such as the quantity of sandwiches ordered for a meeting. Consider whether emails are relevant to your request and consider asking only for emails with attachments. Generally, emails with attachments contain the most interesting information."
