			"You don't have to explain the purpose of your request, and the government agency is not allowed to ask. However, it can help government agencies better understand the documents you are looking for if they know the purpose of your request. Sometimes, it may be wise not to disclose the news you are tracking. Consider what is sensible."

			"You can submit your Woo request on behalf of an (media) organization. Make sure you are authorized to do so and include the authorization with your request. The request may be rejected if you do not have the proper authorization. Also, organizations have a higher fee for appeals to the administrative court than individuals, which can save you a considerable amount. On the other hand, working for a well-known (media) organization can carry weight in the processing of your request. A compromise is to mention the (media) organization you work for without officially submitting the request on its behalf. Tick the option below in that case."

			"There are numerous government agencies, also called 'government bodies,' in the Netherlands: municipalities, provinces, ministries, water boards, the police and inspection services, as well as so-called 'independent administrative bodies' such as the Social Insurance Bank (SVB) and the Central Bureau for Driving Skills (CBR). Under the Woo, as of May 1, 2022, several agencies have been added, including the First and Second Chamber, the Court of Audit, and the National Ombudsman. All these agencies fall under the Woo and can be found via the Woo-generator.",
		p2:
			"The database of government agencies falling under the Woo has been compiled by the members of the Woo working group of the VVOJ. As far as we know, it is the first such database in the Netherlands. All the mentioned agencies are included. However, this does not mean that the database is complete. It is possible that we have overlooked agencies, and government agencies can be abolished or change their names. Therefore, the database is continually evolving. Suggestions and updates are welcome: info@woo-generator.nl",

			"First, consider which government agency the documents on your subject can be found. If you are unsure, search online for your subject and see which government agencies come up. You can also submit the same request to different agencies. Sometimes, one government agency falls under the responsibility of another. For example, if you're not sure whether the documents are with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (IND) or the Ministry of Justice and Security, choose the 'highest' agency, in this case, the ministry. It's true that agencies that are less scrutinized may release documents more easily. So, think about where you have the best chance!",
		p2:
			"And rest assured: the agency where you submit your Woo request is obliged to forward your request to the correct agency. For added security, the generator reminds the government agency of this obligation in the 'referral' paragraph."

			"If you know the name of the highest-ranking official of the agency, such as the minister, the state secretary, the commissioner of the king, etc., you can add it yourself after downloading your draft Wob request. But it's not mandatory. Simply use 'Dear sir/madam' if you don't have the name."
	},
	8: {
		id: "8",
		h1: "Why you need to be precise",
		p:
			"A too broad or unclear formulation of your subject may lead to the government requesting clarification. Under the Woo, the government agency must notify you of this within two weeks of receiving your request. Only after you have specified your request does the decision period begin. Unnecessary weeks may pass before the government processes your request."

If you are unsure whether your request concerns environmental information, check Article 19.1a of the Environmental Management Act."

This way, you gain insight into the creation of the document(s), the individuals or organizations involved, changes in direction, etc.",
		p2:
			"To limit the complexity of the Woo-generator, it is not possible to check both options at the same time. If you genuinely want all documents on this subject, you will need to generate and send two separate letters. The government body may still treat both letters as one request. Keep in mind that the more documents you request, the longer it may take to receive them. Make sure to send both letters on the same day if you want the deadlines to be the same."

		p2:
			"It is usually wise to limit such a request in time and exclude certain document types. After all, you don't want to be overwhelmed with irrelevant documents, nor do you want to unnecessarily burden civil servants and, as a result, wait unnecessarily long for documents. You can indicate this on the next page."

Of course, you can also ask the government for information that is not already on a data carrier, such as what the municipality thinks about a specific development or what the municipality plans to do about it. That is not a Woo request but a regular information request. The Woo-generator is not intended for this purpose."

			"It is usually wise to limit such a request in time and exclude certain document types. After all, you don't want to be overwhelmed with irrelevant documents, nor do you want to unnecessarily burden civil servants and, as a result, wait unnecessarily long for documents. Emails, for example, can provide insight into the decision-making process, the tone of communication between certain individuals, and the frequency of contact. But emails can also be about entirely irrelevant matters, such as the number of sandwiches ordered for the meeting. So, consider whether emails are relevant to your request and consider asking only for emails that include attachments. Usually, emails with attachments contain the most interesting information."
